## Why are some words so hard to type

There are some words that are hard to type, such as the word "however". It can be challenging because of the number of letters in it. If you want to type faster and increase your wpm, this article is for you! You will find tips and guides on how to touch-type efficiently.  

If a word has a lot of letters that you have to type with the same finger, you wont be able to type it as fast as a word that you use your fingers only once. A "easy" word is a word that you can type with a good finger placement and just one movement, like the word "point" or "power".  

When you practice a lot and get to about 80 wpm, the best way to improve your speed is to stop seeing words as a bunch of letters, and start seeing them like accords of a piano.This way you can remember the finger placement and can easily move to other words that use the same fingers.  


"official" its a tricky word. That’s a lot of letters that you type with the same fingers and need to be put into the right order, so it’s a hard word. You want to break it down into parts and write them separately: of-fi-cial. You can do this by taking your fingers off the keyboard, putting one finger on each letter, then typing in only one movement without letting go of any fingers or repeating any steps.


"power" its a easy word. You can type it in only movement, since you can use all your fingers quick succession .

 Keep your fingers on the keyboard, and move quickly but fluidly with short hand movements.

So instead of taking off your fingers from the keyboard and writing it down like I did for "official", try this technique by typing out each letter with a different finger without letting go of any keys or repeating any steps to make sure you're doing it right.


Typing easy and familiar words is very satisfying and can be a very nice form of stress relief.  When you’re trying to write something, and the words keep slipping your mind as soon as you lose yourself in the keys. 

On our site you can select a training mode where you can practice easy, medium, and hard common words.
